The TFProtocol works by sending text commands from client to the
server in a TCP connection. Every time a command is received at the
server it responds with a command execution status. TFProtocol has
evolved from its origin to become a modular meta-protocol that allows
the addition of any type of module to gain functionalities. Those
functionalietes goes from the main core that allows text commands
execution- to complex modules that give you the posiblity to implement
chat applications or even execute any thrid-party modules at the
server side written in any language. Example of those modules are the
support added to run the main databases services like PostgreSQL or
MySQL.

With TFProtocol you can develop Android Apps that can be integrated
through network communication with other apps or services like web
sites or IoT devices. The frontiers of what you may do with TFProtocol
and in particular with its ACE Subsystem it is only limited by your
imagination.

Extended Arbitrary Code Execution or ACE allows only to execute the next 
binaries inside the sandbox (in production you can execute any binary you want, 
so you are able to run any web backend like Django, .NET CORE, etc...) 
The **inskey** for access to ACE it is **tfproto**
